/* 
Here, we will do the spanning tree and triangulation algorithm.

In fact, first we have to do the graphs of the points with gotoxy or any library that allow us graph the triangulation and incenters of this triangles

1- Get the points

2- Plot the points

3- Make the triangulation and get the incenters

4- Make an algorithm that connects these incenters

5- Graph the expantion tree
